## Overview
This repository contains two implementations of a Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator:
1. **C Implementation** (`bmi_calculator.c`)
2. **Python Implementation** (`bmi_calculator.py`)

The BMI Calculator is a simple tool to calculate the Body Mass Index based on a person's weight and height. BMI is a widely used measure to determine whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. This project demonstrates the implementation of BMI calculation in both C and Python, showcasing the versatility of these programming languages.

## Files

### `bmi_calculator.c`
- A C program that calculates BMI interactively.
- Compile the program using GCC or any compatible C compiler.
- Example command to compile:
  ```bash
  gcc bmi_calculator.c -o bmi_calculator
  ```
- Run the compiled executable to calculate BMI interactively.

### `bmi_calculator.py`
- A Python script that calculates BMI interactively.
- Requires Python 3.x to run.
- Run the script using the following command:
  ```bash
  python bmi_calculator.py
  ```

## How to Use

### C Implementation
1. Compile the program using the provided build task or manually using GCC.
2. Run the executable to input weight and height interactively.

### Python Implementation
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Run the script and follow the prompts to input weight and height.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome and appreciated! Here are some ways you can contribute:

### Suggest Enhancements
- Propose new features or improvements.
- Optimize performance or add additional functionality.

### Submit Pull Requests
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`.
3. Make your changes with clear, commented code.
4. Test thoroughly with different inputs.
5. Submit a pull request with a detailed description of your changes.

### Ideas for Contribution
- Add more robust input validation and error handling.
- Implement unit tests for the Python script.
- Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the BMI calculator.
- Add support for additional languages or platforms.

Please ensure any code contributions maintain the existing style and include appropriate documentation.
